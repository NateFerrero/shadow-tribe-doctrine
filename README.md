# Shadow Tribe Doctrine

A voluntary open specification for human behavior intended to result in human connection and inner peace.

## Terminology Used

**MUST** indicates that the specification demands absolute adherence in relation to the action presented.

**SHOULD** indicates that the specification highly recommends the action presented.

**MAY** indicates that the specification presents an optional action.

**NOT** negates the action presented, thus **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY NOT** should be considered the negation of the previous terms.

**GOAL** refers to human connection and inner peace, and the idea that all human beings MUST feel this way.

**SELF** refers to the individual who voluntarily decides to adopt this specification.

**OTHER/OTHERS** refers to individuals who are not the SELF.

**PREMISE** means the idea that there is one set of human behavior toward the SELF and OTHERS that will maximize the achievement of the GOAL.

**CAUSE** means the mechanism or supporting inputs that result in or lead to an outcome.

**BECAUSE** indicates a presentation of a CAUSE.

**POSSIBLE/POSSIBLY** indicates an unknown element.

**THEREFORE** indicates the summation of an argument.

**FORK** means to click on the Fork button on the top right of this Github repository and fork the repository to the SELF's Github account.

**PULL REQUEST** means to create a pull request using Github tools, from the SELF's fork to an OTHER's fork.

## Apologies

This document is written in English, and it MUST be translated into all languages of the Earth, as this specification spreads in understanding, BECAUSE PREMISE.

## Contributing

SELF must FORK and PULL REQUEST as information, knowledge and wisdom are discovered during life.

## Vision

This document represents a search for something lost within ourselves. POSSIBLY we never had it, yet we still aspire to it. A dream of a world where we are not merely observers, but architects.

## Delay

Often, a time delay is needed to allow the SELF processing time to understand new information correctly and thoroughly. Throughout this document, situations will arise resulting in a delay. Judgment MAY be used in adjusting the length of a delay shorter or longer. However, some delays that SHOULD be used are presented here.

**DELAY 1/60** = 1 minute

**DELAY 1/12** = 5 minutes

**DELAY 1/6** = 10 minutes

**DELAY 1/3** = 20 minutes

**DELAY 1/2** = 30 minutes

**DELAY 2/3** = 40 minutes

**DELAY 1** = 60 minutes

**DELAY 12** = 12 hours

**DELAY 1d** = 24 hours

**DELAY 3d** = 3 days

**DELAY 1w** = 7 days

**DELAY 52w** = 1 year
